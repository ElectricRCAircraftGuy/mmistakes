# Oh hey — I'm Michael Rose

Just another bearded, tattooed, time traveling designer from Buffalo, New York.

I’m into [drawing portraits of strangers](https://mademistakes.com/procreate-paintings/) on an iPad Pro, eating popcorn and chicken wings, watching dust collect on [my vinyl record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing single-player console exclusives.

When I’m not drawing or releasing open source [Jekyll themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/), I work as a web designer and content administrator for a leading global provider of laboratory products. On any given day I’m designing user-interfaces, building landing pages, and massaging content in and out of a CMS with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasn’t enough to keep me busy — I’m also the father of twin girls and married to a [subscription box addicted vegan](https://2littlerosebuds.com/).
